     * The knapsack problem is a np complete problem.
     * 
     * A NP Complete problem is a problem that is nondeterministic in polynomial time.
     * Simply put there are several ways that a solution can solve a nondeterministic
     * problem. The solution can perform in polynomial time or exponential time depending
     * on the decisions it makes during execution.  The solution is also not garunteed
     * to run with consistant peformance from one execution to another.
     * 
     * Generally speaking, algorithms built to solve problems are deterministic in
     * polynomial time.  In other words, the solution follows a consistant measurable path
     * each time it is executed.  This algorithm will break the general speaking mold.
     * 
     * The goal here is to provide a nondeterministic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem.
     * 
     * Now that we have comunicated the complixity of the knapsack problem, lets 
     * define what a knapsack problem is, and the objective of our solution.
